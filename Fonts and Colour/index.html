            <h1>What of the hunting</h1> 
                <!-- In this paragraph he talks about his brother and what happened in the jungle -->
                <p>What of the hunting, hunter bold? Brother, the watch was long andcold.What of the quarry ye went to kill? Brother, he crops in the junglestill.Where is the power that made your pride? Brother, it ebbs from myflank and side.Where is the haste that ye hurry by? Brother, I go to my lair to die.WHEN  MOWGLI  LEFT  the  wolf’s  cave  after  the  fight  with  thePack  at  the  Council  Rock,  he  went  down  to  the  plowed  landswhere  the  villagers  lived,  but  he  would  not  stop  there  because  itwas  too  near  to  the  jungle,  and  he  knew  that  he  had  made  at  leastone  bad  enemy  at  the  Council.  So  he  hurried  on,  keeping  to  therough  road  that  ran  down  the  valley,  and  followed  it  at  a  steadyjog  trot  for  nearly  twenty  miles,  till  he  came  to  a  country  that  hedid not know.</p> 


                    <h2>The valley opened </h2> 
                    
                            <p>The valley opened out into a great plain dotted overwith rocks and cut up by ravines. At one end stood a little village,and  at  the  other  the  thick  jungle  came  down  in  a  sweep  to  thegrazing  grounds,  and  stopped  there  as  though  it  had  been  cut  off with  a  hoe.  All  over  the  plain,  cattle  and  buffaloes  were  grazing,and  when  the  little  boys  in  charge  of  the  herds  saw  Mowgli  theyshouted and ran away, and the yellow pariah dogs that hang aboutevery Indian village barked. Mowgli walked on, for he was feeling hungry,  and  when  he  came  to  the  village  gate  he  saw  the  bigthornbush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight, pushed toone side.“Umph!”  he  said,  for  he  had  come  across  more  than  one  suchbarricade  in  his  night  rambles  after  things  to  eat.  “So  men  areafraid  of  the  People  of  the  Jungle  here  also.”  He  sat  down  by  thegate,  and  when  a  man  came  out  he  stood  up,  opened  his  mouth,and pointed down it to show that he wanted food. The man stared,and ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest,who  was  a  big,  fat  man  dressed  in  white,  with  a  red  and  yellowmark on his forehead.</p>  
                            
                            
                            <h3>The priest came</h3> 
                            
                                    <p>The priest came to the gate, and with him atleast  a  hundred  people,  who  stared  and  talked  and  shouted  andpointed at Mowgli.“They have no manners, these Men Folk,” said Mowgli to himself.“Only  the  gray  ape  would  behave  as  they  do.”  So  he  threw  backhis long hair and frowned at the crowd.“What is there to be afraid of?” said the priest. “Look at the markson his arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child run away from the jungle.” Of course, in playing together, thecubs  had  often  nipped  Mowgli  harder  than  they  intended,  and there  were  white  scars  all  over  his  arms  and  legs.  But  he  wouldhave  been  the  last  person  in  the  world  to  call  these  bites,  for  heknew what real biting meant.“Arre!  Arre!”  said  two  or  three  women  together.  “To  be  bitten  bywolves,  poor  child!  He  is  a  handsome  boy.  He  has  eyes  like  redfire. By my honor, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was takenby  the  tiger.”  “Let  me  look,”  said  a  woman  with  heavy  copperrings  on  her  wrists  and  ankles,  and  she  peered  at  Mowgli  underthe  palm  of  her  hand.  “Indeed  he  is  not.  He  is  thinner,  but  he  hasthe  very  look  of  my  boy.”  The  priest  was  a  clever  man,  and  heknew  that  Messua  was  wife  to  the  richest  villager  in  the  place.  Sohe looked up at the sky for a minute and said solemnly: “What thejungle  has  taken  the  jungle  has  restored.  Take  the  boy  into  thyhouse, my sister, and forget not to honor the priest who sees so farinto  the  lives  of  men.”  “By  the  Bull  that  bought  me,”  said  Mowglito  himself,  “but  all  this  talking  is  like  another  looking  over  by  thePack!  Well,  if  I  am  a  man,  a  man  I  must  be.” </p>
                            
                            
                                        <h4>The  crowd  parted</h4> 
                               
                                             <p>The  crowd  parted  asthe  woman  beckoned  Mowgli  to  her  hut,  where  there  was  a  red-lacquered  bedstead,  a  great  earthen  grain  chest  with  funny  raisedpatterns  on  it,  half  a  dozen  copper  cooking  pots,  an  image  of  aHindu  god  in  a  little  alcove,  and  on  the  wall  a  real  looking  glass,such as they sell at the country fairs for eight cents.She  gave  him  a  long  drink  of  milk  and  some  bread,  and  then  shelaid her hand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thoughtperhaps  that  he  might  be  her  real  son  come  back  from  the  junglewhere  the  tiger  had  taken  him.  So  she  said,  “Nathoo,  O  Nathoo!”Mowgli  did  not  show  that  he  knew  the  name.  “Dost  thou  notremember  the  day  when  I  gave  thee  thy  new  shoes?”  She  touchedhis  foot,  and  it  was  almost  as  hard  as  horn.  “No,”  she  saidsorrowfully,  “those  feet  have  never  worn  shoes,  but  thou  art  verylike  my  Nathoo,  and  thou  shalt  be  my  son.”  Mowgli  was  uneasy,because he had never been under a roof before. But as he looked atthe thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he wanted toget  away,  and  that  the  window  had  no  fastenings.  “What  is  thegood   of   a   man,”   he   said   to   himself   at   last,   “if   he   does   notunderstand  man’s  talk?  Now  I  am  as  silly  and  dumb  as  a  manwould  be  with  us  in  the  jungle.  I  must  speak  their  talk.”  He  hadnot  learned  while  he  was  with  the  wolves  to  imitate  the  challengeof  bucks  in  the  jungle  and  the  grunt  of  the  little  wild  pig  for  fun.So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate italmost  perfectly,  and  before  dark  he  had  learned  the  names  ofmany things in the hut.There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleepunder  anything  that  looked  so  like  a  panther  trap  as  that  hut,  andwhen they shut the door he went through the window. </p>  
                               
                              
                                               <h5>Give  him  his  will</h5>
                                               
                                               <p> Give  him  his  will,”  said  Messua’s  husband.  “Remember  he  cannever till now have slept on a bed. If he is indeed sent in the placeof our son he will not run away.”So  Mowgli  stretched  himself  in  some  long,  clean  grass  at  the  edgeof  the  field,  but  before  he  had  closed  his  eyes  a  soft  gray  nosepoked him under the chin.“Phew!”  said  Gray  Brother  (he  was  the  eldest  of  Mother  Wolf’scubs). “This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thousmellest  of  wood  smoke  and  cattle-  altogether  like  a  man  already.Wake,  Little  Brother;  I  bring  news.”  “Are  all  well  in  the  jungle?”said Mowgli, hugging him.“All  except  the  wolves  that  were  burned  with  the  Red  Flower.Now, listen.Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows again,for  he  is  badly  singed.  When  he  returns  he  swears  that  he  will  laythy bones in the Waingunga.” “There are two words to that. I alsohave  made  a  little  promise.  But  news  is  always  good.  I  am  tiredtonight- very tired with new things, Gray Brother- but bring me thenews always.” “Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men willnot make thee forget?” said Gray Brother anxiously.“Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave.But  also  I  will  always  remember  that  I  have  been  cast  out  of  thePack.” “And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men areonly men, Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in apond. </p>
                                               
                                               <h1>When  I  come  down  here  again</h1>

                                               
                                        <p>When  I  come  down  here  again,  I  will  wait  for  thee  in  thebamboos  at  the  edge  of  the  grazing  ground.”  For  three  monthsafter that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village gate, he was sobusy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had to wear aclothround him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had to learnabout money, which he did not in the least understand, and aboutplowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children inthe  village  made  him  very  angry.  Luckily,  the  Law  of  the  Junglehad  taught  him  to  keep  his  temper,  for  in  the  jungle  life  and  fooddepend on keeping your temper.But when they made fun of him because he would not play gamesor  fly  kites,  or  because  he  mispronounced  some  word,  only  theknowledge  that  it  was  unsportsmanlike  to  kill  little  naked  cubskept him from picking them up and breaking them in two. He didnot  know  his  own  strength  in  the  least.  In  the  jungle  he  knew  hewas weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people saidthat he was as strong as a bull. He certainly had no notion of whatfear  was,  for  when  the  village  priest  told  him  that  the  god  in  thetemple would be angry with him if he ate the priest’s mangoes, hepicked  up  the  image,  brought  it  over  to  the  priest’s  house,  and asked the priest to make the god angry and he would be happy tofight  him.  It  was  a  horrible  scandal,  but  the  priest  hushed  it  up,and Messua’s husband paid much good silver to comfort the god.And  Mowgli  had  not  the  faintest  idea  of  the  difference  that  castemakes between man and man. When the potter’s donkey slipped inthe  clay  pit,  Mowgli  hauled  it  out  by  the  tail,  and  helped  to  stackthe  pots  for  their  journey  to  the  market  at  Khanhiwara.</p> 
                                        

                                    <h2>That  wasvery  shocking</h2>    
                                
                            <p>That  wasvery  shocking,  too,  for  the  potter  is  a  low-caste  man,  and  hisdonkey is worse. When the priest scolded him, Mowgli threatenedto   put   him   on   the   donkey   too,   and   the   priest   told   Messua’shusband that Mowgli had better be set to work as soon as possible.So  the  village  headman  told  Mowgli  that  he  would  have  to  go  outwith the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they grazed.No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because hehad been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went offto  a  circle  that  met  every  evening  on  a  masonry  platform  under  agreat  fig  tree.  It  was  the  village  club,  and  the  headman  and  thewatchman  and  the  barber,  who  knew  all  the  gossip  of  the  village,and old Buldeo, the village hunter, who had a Tower musket, metand  smoked.  The  monkeys  sat  and  talked  in  the  upper  branches,and  there  was  a  hole  under  the  platform  where  a  cobra  lived,  andhe had his little platter of milk every night because he was sacred.The  old  men  sat  around  the  tree  and  talked,  and  pulled  at  the  bighuqas (the water pipes) till far into the night. They told wonderfultales  of  gods  and  men  and  ghosts;  and  Buldeo  told  even  morewonderful  ones  of  the  ways  of  beasts  in  the  jungle,  till  the  eyes  ofthe  children  sitting  outside  the  circle  bulged  out  of  their  heads.Most  of  the  tales  were  about  animals,  for  the  jungle  was  always  attheir door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops, andnow  and  again  the  tiger  carried  off  a  man  at  twilight,  within  sightof the village gates.Mowgli,  who  naturally  knew  something  about  what  they  weretalking  of,  had  to  cover  his  face  not  to  show  that  he  was  laughing,while Buldeo, the Tower musket across his knees, climbed on fromone wonderful story to another, and Mowgli’s shoulders shook.Buldeo   was   explaining   how   the   tiger   that   had   carried   awayMessua’s son was a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by theghost of a wicked, old moneylender, who had died some years ago.“And  I  know  that  this  is  true,”  he  said,  “because  Purun  Dassalways limped from the blow that he got in a riot when his accountbooks  were  burned,  and  the  tiger  that  I  speak  of  he  limps,  too,  forthe  tracks  of  his  pads  are  unequal.”  “True,  true,  that  must  be  thetruth, said the gray-beards, nodding together.“Are  all  these  tales  such  cobwebs  and  moon  talk?”  said  Mowgli.“That  tiger  limps  because  he  was  born  lame,  as  everyone  knows.</p>    
                            
                        <h3>To  talk  of  the  soul </h3>       
                    
                    
            
                    <p>To  talk  of  the  soul  of  a  moneylender  in  a  beast  that  never  had  thecourage  of  a  jackal  is  child’s  talk.”  Buldeo  was  speechless  withsurprise for a moment, and the headman stared.“Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?” said Buldeo. “If thou art so wise,better  bring  his  hide  to  Khanhiwara,  for  the  Government  has  set  ahundred  rupees  on  his  life.  Better  still,  talk  not  when  thy  eldersspeak.”  Mowgli  rose  to  go.  “All  the  evening  I  have  lain  herelistening,”  he  called  back  over  his  shoulder,  “and,  except  once  ortwice, Buldeo has not said one word of truth concerning the jungle,which  is  at  his  very  doors.  How,  then,  shall  I  believe  the  tales  ofghosts and gods and goblins which he says he has seen?” “It is fulltime  that  boy  went  to  herding,”  said  the  headman,  while  Buldeopuffed and snorted at Mowgli’s impertinence.The  custom  of  most  Indian  villages  is  for  a  few  boys  to  take  thecattle  and  buffaloes  out  to  graze  in  the  early  morning,  and  bringthem back at night. The very cattle that would trample a white manto death allow themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted atby children that hardly come up to their noses. So long as the boyskeep with the herds they are safe, for not even the tiger will chargea mob of cattle. But if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards,they are sometimes carried off.Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting on theback  of  Rama,  the  great  herd  bull. </p> 
                       
                       
                <h4>The  slaty-blue  buffaloes</h4>               
                
               
            <p>The  slaty-blue  buffaloes,  withtheir  long,  backwardsweeping  horns  and  savage  eyes,  rose  outtheir  byres,  one  by  one,  and  followed  him,  and  Mowgli  made  itvery clear to the children with him that he was the master. He beatthe  buffaloes  with  a  long,  polished  bamboo,  and  told  Kamya,  oneof  the  boys,  to  graze  the  cattle  by  themselves,  while  he  went  onwith  the  buffaloes,  and  to  be  very  careful  not  to  stray  away  fromthe herd.An Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrubs and tussocks andlittle  ravines,  among  which  the  herds  scatter  and  disappear.  Thebuffaloes  generally  keep  to  the  pools  and  muddy  places,  wherethey lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowglidrove them on to the edge of the plain where the Waingunga cameout of the jungle; then he dropped from Rama’s neck, trotted off toa bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother.“Ah,”  said  Gray  Brother,  “I  have  waited  here  very  many  days.What is the meaning of this cattle-herding work?”“It  is  an  order,”  said  Mowgli.  “I  am  a  village  herd  for  a  while.What  news  of  Shere  Khan?”  “He  has  come  back  to  this  country,and has waited here a long time for thee.Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means tokill  thee.”  “Very  good,”  said  Mowgli.  “So  long  as  he  is  away  dothou  or  one  of  the  four  brothers  sit  on  that  rock,  so  that  I  can  see thee as I come out of the village. When he comes back wait for mein  the  ravine  by  the  dhak  tree  in  the  center  of  the  plain.  We  neednot  walk  into  Shere  Khan’s  mouth.”  Then  Mowgli  picked  out  ashady  place,  and  lay  down  and  slept  while  the  buffaloes  grazedround  him.  Herding  in  India  is  one  of  the  laziest  things  in  theworld.The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move on again, andthey  do  not  even  low.  They  only  grunt,  and  the  buffaloes  veryseldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one afteranother, and work their way into the mud till only their noses andstaring  china-blue  eyes  show  above  the  surface,  and  then  they  lielike logs.The  sun  makes  the  rocks  dance  in  the  heat,  and  the  herd  childrenhear  one  kite  (never  any  more)  whistling  almost  out  of  sightoverhead, and they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kitewould  sweep  down,  and  the  next  kite  miles  away  would  see  himdrop and follow, and the next, and the next, and almost before theywere  dead  there  would  be  a  score  of  hungry  kites  come  out  ofnowhere.Then they sleep and wake and sleep again, and weave little basketsof dried grass and put grasshoppers in them; or catch two prayingmantises and make them fight; or string a necklace of red and blackjungle nuts; or watch a lizard basking on a rock, or a snake huntinga frog near the wallows. Then they sing long, long songs with oddnative  quavers  at  the  end  of  them,  and  the  day  seems  longer  thanmost  people’s  whole  lives,  and  perhaps  they  make  a  mud  castlewith  mud  figures  of  men  and  horses  and  buffaloes,  and  put  reedsinto  the  men’s  hands,  and  pretend  that  they  are  kings  and  thefigures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped.Then   evening   comes   and   the   children   call,   and   the   buffaloeslumber  up  out  of  the  sticky  mud  with  noises  like  gunshots  goingoff one after the other, and they all string across the gray plain backto the twinkling village lights.Day   after   day   Mowgli   would   lead   the   buffaloes   out   to   theirwallows,  and  day  after  day  he  would  see  Gray  Brother’s  back  amile and a half away across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khanhad  not  come  back),  and  day  after  day  he  would  lie  on  the  grasslistening to the noises round him, and dreaming of old days in thejungle.  If  Shere  Khan  had  made  a  false  step  with  his  lame  paw  upin the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would have heard him inthose long, still mornings.At  last  a  day  came  when  he  did  not  see  Gray  Brother  at  the  signalplace,  and  he  laughed  and  headed  the  buffaloes  for  the  ravine  bythe  dhak  tree,  which  was  all  covered  with  golden-red  flowers.There sat Gray Brother, every bristle on his back lifted.
